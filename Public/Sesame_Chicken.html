        <hr />
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>For the Chicken</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 lb (700 g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying (about 2–3 cups)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brown sugar (packed)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp hoisin sauce (optional, for depth)</li>
            <li>2 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 3 tbsp cold water (slurry)</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp grated fresh ginger</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Garnish</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
            <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Cooked white rice or steamed vegetables, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat the chicken pieces dry. In a large bowl combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Dip chicken pieces into the beaten eggs, then toss to coat in the flour mixture. Shake off excess.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet or pot to 350°F (175°C). Fry chicken in batches until golden brown and cooked through, about 4–6 minutes per batch. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl whisk together soy sauce, water, brown sugar, rice vinegar, hoisin (if using), and sesame oil. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or wok over medium heat, add a tablespoon of oil and sauté garlic and ginger about 30 seconds until fragrant (do not burn).</li>
            <li>Pour the prepared sauce into the skillet and bring to a gentle simmer. Stir in the cornstarch slurry and cook until the sauce thickens and becomes glossy, about 1–2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the fried chicken to the skillet and toss to coat evenly with the sauce. Cook 1–2 minutes so the chicken absorbs the sauce.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and sliced green onions. Serve immediately over steamed rice or with vegetables.</li>
        </ol>

 <h3>Notes & Tips</h3>
        <p>For extra crispiness, double-fry the chicken—fry once at a lower temperature to cook through, drain, then fry again quickly at higher heat to crisp. Adjust sugar and vinegar to taste for a sweeter or tangier sauce. Leftovers keep well and can be reheated in a hot oven to preserve crispness.</p>
