    <h1>Neapolitan Margherita Pizza</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Dough (yields 2–3 pizzas, ~250–300g each)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g Tipo "00" flour</li>
        <li>325 g lukewarm water (65% hydration)</li>
        <li>10 g fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1–2 g active dry yeast (about 1/2–1 tsp) — or 3–4 g fresh yeast</li>
        <li>Optional: 5 g extra-virgin olive oil (authentic Neapolitan often omits oil)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (400 g) San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand, salted to taste</li>
        <li>200–250 g fresh mozzarella (fior di latte or buffalo), torn and well drained</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil for finishing</li>
        <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water and yeast in a bowl until dissolved. Add flour and mix until there are no dry lumps. Add salt (and olive oil if using) and bring the dough together.</li>
        <li>Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8–10 minutes until smooth and slightly elastic. Alternatively, mix in a stand mixer on low for 6–8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Form a ball, place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rest at room temperature 1–2 hours for a short bulk rise, or for best flavor proceed to cold fermentation: refrigerate for 18–48 hours.</li>
        <li>After fermentation, divide the dough into 2–3 equal portions. Shape each portion into a tight ball. Place balls on a floured tray, cover, and proof 1–2 hours at room temperature (or until slightly puffy) before baking.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven on the highest setting with a pizza stone or steel for at least 45–60 minutes. If you have a pizza oven, preheat to the appropriate high temperature (430–485°C / 800–900°F for wood-fired; home ovens typically max ~250–300°C / 475–575°F).</li>
        <li>Gently press and stretch each dough ball from the center outward to form a 10–12" (25–30 cm) disc with a slightly thicker rim. Do not use a rolling pin—keep the edge airy.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of crushed San Marzano tomatoes over the center, leaving the rim bare. Season tomatoes lightly with salt.</li>
        <li>Distribute torn, well-drained mozzarella evenly (less is more to avoid soggy pizza). Add a few basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake: In a very hot wood-fired oven the pizza cooks in ~60–90 seconds. In a home oven at 250–300°C (475–575°F) on a preheated stone/steel, bake 4–6 minutes until crust is puffed and charred in spots and cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven, finish with a few fresh basil leaves and a final drizzle of olive oil. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes & Tips</h3>
    <p>For the clearest tomato flavor, use whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes crushed by hand—no extra seasoning beyond salt is necessary.</p>
    <p>Drain mozzarella in a sieve or pat dry to reduce excess moisture and prevent a soggy center.</p>
    <p>Long, cold fermentation (24–48 hours) gives the dough more flavor and better digestibility. If short on time, a 2–4 hour room-temperature rise will still work.</p>
    <p>If you lack a pizza stone/steel, use the oven's highest rack and a preheated inverted baking sheet to approximate a hot surface.</p>
