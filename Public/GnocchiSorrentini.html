            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the potatoes whole (with skins) until very tender: bake at 200°C/400°F about 45–60 minutes or boil until a skewer passes easily. Drain if boiled.</li>
                <li>While hot, peel the potatoes and pass them through a ricer or mash very finely on a clean surface. Spread the warm mashed potato into an even layer to let a little steam escape (this helps dry it).</li>
                <li>Add the salt and beaten egg to the warm potato. Sprinkle about half the flour over the potato and gently incorporate. Add more flour as needed to form a soft, slightly tacky dough — avoid overworking.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into portions. Roll each portion into ropes about 1.5–2 cm (½–¾ in) thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut ropes into 2 cm (¾ in) pieces. If desired, roll each piece over the back of a fork or a gnocchi board to create ridges.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Cook gnocchi in batches: drop them in and stir gently. They are done when they float and are tender, about 1–2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon into a bowl.</li>
                <li>Make the sauce: heat olive oil in a wide skillet, add garlic and cook briefly until fragrant (don’t let it brown). Add crushed tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and simmer 10–15 minutes until slightly reduced. Stir in torn basil.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked gnocchi to the sauce, gently toss to coat. Stir in most of the mozzarella so it begins to melt (reserve some for topping).</li>
                <li>Transfer sauced gnocchi to an ovenproof dish, sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and grated Parmesan. Finish under a hot broiler or in a 220°C/425°F oven for 5–8 minutes until cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
                <li>Garnish with extra basil leaves and serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Notes & Tips</h2>
            <p>Use starchy potatoes (russet) for lighter gnocchi. Work quickly and only add as much flour as needed — too much flour makes dense gnocchi. For an extra-light texture, bake the potatoes instead of boiling to reduce water content. Leftover gnocchi can be frozen uncooked on a tray and transferred to a bag once firm.</p>
